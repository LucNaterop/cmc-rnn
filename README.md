# Classical Music Composition with Recurrent Neural Networks.

This repo is the code of an ETH project from Luca Naterop and Sandro Giacomuzzi which aims to synthesize Audio with LSTMs. 


`/tf-rnn`: The main code of this project

`/csv-rnn`: Torch LSTM implementation in 

`/char-rnn`: The code for a character language model in torch which was trained with Darwin and the Koran.

`/char-rnn-results`: contains sample text of 100'000 characters generated from those networks as well as the corresponding checkpoints that allows you to generate more text.
